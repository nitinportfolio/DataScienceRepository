    "## Discretisation with k-means clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "This discretisation method consists in applying k-means clustering to the continuous variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Briefly, the algorithm works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1) Initialization: random creation of K centers\n",
    "- 2) Each data point is associated with the closest center\n",
    "- 3) Each center position is re-computed as the center of its associated points\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until convergence is reached. The algorithm minimises the pairwise squared deviations of points within the same cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "More details about k-means [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering)\n",
    "\n",
    "Nice blog with graphical explanation of k-means [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-does-k-means-clustering-in-machine-learning-work-fdaaaf5acfa0) \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the user, needs to define the number of clusters, as with equal width and equal frequency discretisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## In this demo\n",
    "\n",
    "We will learn how to perform k-means discretisation using the Titanic dataset and Scikit-learn"
